## üî® Installation
Clone the repository and run the following in your terminal:
```bash
> npm i
```
This installs all neccessary packages. Mext, run the following:
```bash
> node app.js
```
In a separate terminal run the following: 
```bash
> mongod
```
This activates MongoDB on your local device; however, note that cloning this repo to your local device means that the database will be empty. To see the full effect of the web app, create an account to put your first bit of data into your local database.

## üß† Challenges we ran into
<p> One of the challenges I had to overcome was managing image storage. Because the prompt was to create a digital art app and I wanted to create a full stack application, image storage was a huge issue. I was originally going to use Cloudinary to upload images but I realized users could essentially upload as many images as they wanted and I would quickly run out of free storage. So instead I converted image urls to dataurls and stored the dataurls in our Mongo database. That way we minimize image storage but images are still accessible across browsers. </p> 

## üèÖ Accomplishments that we're proud of
<ul>
    <li>I created my first art-based app</li>
    <li>I got more familar with event-listeners</li>
    <li>This is the fastest I have ever deployed a full stack application</li>
</ul>
